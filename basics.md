### primitive types

- **byte**: The `byte` data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). The `byte` data type can be useful for saving memory in large [arrays](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html), where the memory savings actually matters. They can also be used in place of `int` where their limits help to clarify your code; the fact that a variable's range is limited can serve as a form of documentation.
- **short**: The `short` data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). As with `byte`, the same guidelines apply: you can use a `short` to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters.
- **int**: By default, the `int` data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the `int` data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1. Use the Integer class to use `int` data type as an unsigned integer. See the section The Number Classes for more information. Static methods like `compareUnsigned`, `divideUnsigned` etc have been added to the [`Integer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html) class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers.
- **long**: The `long` data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the `long` data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1. Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by `int`. The [`Long`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html) class also contains methods like `compareUnsigned`, `divideUnsigned` etc to support arithmetic operations for unsigned long.
- **float**: The `float` data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the [Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3) section of the Java Language Specification. As with the recommendations for `byte` and `short`, use a `float` (instead of `double`) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. This data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. For that, you will need to use the [java.math.BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html) class instead. [Numbers and Strings](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/index.html) covers `BigDecimal` and other useful classes provided by the Java platform.
- **double**: The `double` data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the [Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3) section of the Java Language Specification. For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.
- **boolean**: The `boolean` data type has only two possible values: `true` and `false`. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely defined.
- **char**: The `char` data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of `'\u0000'` (or 0) and a maximum value of `'\uffff'` (or 65,535 inclusive).



`String`: object

compare objects: `.equals()`

```java
String person1 = "Paul";
String person2 = "John";
String person3 = "Paul";
 
System.out.println(person1.equals(person2));
// Prints false, since "Paul" is not "John"
 
System.out.println(person1.equals(person3));
// Prints true, since "Paul" is "Paul"
```



### `final` keyword

To declare a variable with a value that cannot be manipulated, we need to use the `final` keyword

```java
final int yearBorn = 1968;
yearBorn = 1990; // error: cannot assign a value to final variable yearBorn
```



## Class

structure

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  int inventoryCount;
  double inventoryPrice;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product, int count, double price) {
    productType = product;
    inventoryCount = count;
    inventoryPrice = price;
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Store lemonadeStand = new Store("lemonade", 42, .99);
    Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies", 12, 3.75);
    
    System.out.println("Our first shop sells " + lemonadeStand.productType + " at " + lemonadeStand.inventoryPrice + " per unit.");
    
    System.out.println("Our second shop has " + cookieShop.inventoryCount + " units remaining.");
  }
}
```



constructor overload:

```java
public class Car {
  String color;
  int mpg;
  boolean isElectric;
 
  // constructor 1
  public Car(String carColor, int milesPerGallon) {
    color = carColor;
    mpg = milesPerGallon;
  }
  // constructor 2
  public Car(boolean electricCar, int milesPerGallon) {
    isElectric = electricCar;
    mpg = milesPerGallon;
  }
}
```
